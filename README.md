# CS-330
How do I approach designing software?

Taking CS-330 taught me how to render images using code. I do digital artwork as a hobby, so it was interesting to make something artistic using nothing but programming. I didn't really have a design process during this course. At the beginning of the term, I had no idea what OpenGL was or what I would be doing, so I was mostly winging it week to week. By the time I understood what I was doing, I was locked into my early design choices. It wasn't an ideal situation, but not without its merits. While I prefer to approach software design in a more deliberate fashion, that will not always be a possibility. Having to wade through unfamiliar territory and pick up new skills along the way are skills that will come in handy when I enter my field.


How do I approach developing programs?

As with software design, I was unable to develop code for this course following my typical methodology. Since I was unfamiliar with OpenGL, I couldn't formulate specific plans for development. Instead, I had to do extensive research, familiarize myself with the tutorial codebase, and spend many hours using trial and error. The process was rather frustrating, but I learned a lot from it. Typically, I focus on project requirements and decide on data structures based on that, but OpenGL didn't allow me that sort of design control. For this course, I had to figure out how to write code within the boundaries dictated by OpenGL: it took me a while to adjust.
